  El siguiente trabajo es el producto de la finalización del tercer módulo de la Diplomatura de Hidrocarburos de la UNPA.
abstract: |
  A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, 
  abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage
  authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without 
  headings: 1) Introduccion: Place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; 2) Materiales y mètodos: Describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; 3) Caso de estudio: Summarize the article's main findings; and 4) Discusion final y conclusiones: Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions.

# Version

This Rmd-skeleton uses the mdpi Latex template published 2024-04-27. 
However, the official template gets more frequently updated than the **rticles**
package. Therefore, please make sure prior to paper submission, that you're 
using the most recent .cls, .tex and .bst files 
(available [here](http://www.mdpi.com/authors/latex)).

# Article Header Information

The YAML header includes information needed mainly for formatting the front and 
back matter of the article. Required elements include:

```yaml
title: Title of the paper
author:
  - name: first and last name
    affil: |
      One or more comma seperated numbers corresponding to affilitation
      and one or more  comma seperated symbols corresponding 
      optional notes.
    orcid: optional orcid number
affiliation:  
  - num: 1,..., n for each affiliation
    address: required
    email: required
authorcitation: |
  Lastname, F.
correspondence: |
  email@email.com; Tel.: +XX-000-00-0000.
journal: notspecified
type: article
status: submit
```

Journal options are in Table \ref{tab:mdpinames}. The `status` variable should 
generally not be changed by authors. The `type` variable describes 
the type of of submission and defaults to `article` but can be replaced with any of the ones in Table \ref{tab:mdpitype}

```{r mdpitype, echo = FALSE}
type <- c("abstract, addendum, article, book, bookreview, briefreport, 
casereport, comment, commentary, communication, conferenceproceedings, 
correction, conferencereport, entry, expressionofconcern, extendedabstract, 
datadescriptor, editorial, essay, erratum, hypothesis, interestingimage, 
obituary, opinion, projectreport, reply, retraction, review, perspective, 
protocol, shortnote, studyprotocol, systematicreview, supfile, 
technicalnote, viewpoint, guidelines, registeredreport, tutorial")
knitr::kable(rticles::string_to_table(type, 3), 
             col.names = NULL, format = "latex", booktab = TRUE, 
             caption = "MDPI article types.")
```

## Journal Specific YAML variables

```yaml
# for journal Diversity,
# add the Life Science Identifier using:
lsid: http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:nnnn


# for journal Applied Sciences
# add featured application
featuredapplication: |
  Authors are encouraged to provide a concise 
  description of the specific application or 
  a potential application of the work. This 
  section is not mandatory.

# for the journal Data
# add dataset doi and license
dataset: https://doi.org/10.1000/182
datasetlicense: CC-BY-4.0

# for the journal Toxins
# add key contributions
keycontributions: |
  The breakthroughs or highlights of the manuscript. 
  Authors can write one or two sentences to describe 
  the most important part of the paper.

# for the journal Encyclopedia
encyclopediadef: |
  For entry manuscripts only: please provide a brief overview
  of the entry title instead of an abstract.
entrylink: The Link to this entry published on the encyclopedia platform.

# for the journal Advances in Respiratory Medicine
# add highlights
addhighlights: |
  This is an obligatory section in “Advances in Respiratory Medicine”, 
  whose goal is to increase the discoverability and readability of the
  article via search engines and other scholars. Highlights should not 
  be a copy of the abstract, but a simple text allowing the reader to 
  quickly and simplified find out what the article is about and what can 
  be cited from it. Each of these parts should be devoted up to 2~bullet 
  points.
